1. In a bowl, beat the margarine and sugar for around 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.
1. Add egg replacement gloop (or actual eggs), finely grate and add the zest from 2 lemons and 1 orange, then mix to combine.
1. Sieve the flour, baking powder and xanthan gum into the bowl, then fold through. Stir in the juice from 1 lemon and ½ an orange until you have a nice, smooth mixture.
1. Pour the mixture into the cake tin, smooth out to the edges, then place on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 35 minutes, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean.
1. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, before turning the cake out onto a wire cooling rack, then leave to cool completely while you make the icing.
1. Combine the icing sugar with the zest and juice from ½ a lemon and ¼ of an orange. Once the cake has cooled, drizzle the icing on top, grate over a little lemon and orange zest, then serve.
